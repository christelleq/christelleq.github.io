        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>

          <h4>Blocked by a Single Problem</h4>

          <h4>Solved a Problem Elegantly</h4>

          <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
          <p>
            Confidence: high. I find planning out the code I'm about to write is helpful with moving forward with clarity and efficiency.
          </p>

          <h4>Trying something</h4>
          <p>
            Confidence: very high. This is my first instinct when I code: code whatever steps I think I may need. I just get so excited and want to dive straight into solving the challenge. However, this could be disadvantageous when stepping back, looking at the big picture, planning, and maybe writing some pseudocode would be most beneficial. Stepping back would be especially helpful when starting to write code, or when I get stuck.
          </p>

          <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
          <p>
            Confidence: low. I haven't tried this method. This will probably be the last thing I take out of my toolbox because the idea of it feels uncomfortable, so much so that I imagine I wouldn't be able to think while trying to talk. I would rather talk to my boyfriend, although it's probably not the best use of his time. I would also prefer writing pseudocode or writing down my ideas, vs. speaking them out loud to an inanimate object.
          </p>

          <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
          <p>
            Confidence: medium. I don't get scared of error messages, however I'm haven't mastered understanding them. I always read them to get an idea of where in my code I went wrong, and to develop my ability to understand error messages.
          </p>

          <h4>Console.logging</h4>
          <p>
            Confidence: very high. I find it very useful to console.log each line of code, especially for functions. This technique helps me move forward knowing my prior code works, and to see and know what I'm working with (e.g. arrays, objects, strings, etc.)
          </p>
          
          <h4>Googling</h4>
          <p>
            Confidence: medium. I think I word my searches well, and I've found some great websites for my coding questions: MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, and Medium. However, I've found I'm not always great at picking out important information the first time I read the content. I've gotten better with repetition, and I'm aiming to be more efficient at picking out important information.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
          <p>
            Confidence: low. I haven't tried this. This is probably one of the strategies I'd try, once I've exhausted the above, plus reflection. Although, sometimes I search Discord if I get stuck, and the threads there are often helpful.
          </p>
          
          <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
          <p>
            Confidence: low. Like asking peers for help, it's one of the last strategies I'd try. So far, I haven't had the need to do this, or someone else has already beat me to asking the question, so I just look at the relevant Discord thread.
          </p>

          <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Confidence: medium. I quite like doing journaling exercises in general. A couple exercises I like to do are: writing my goals for the day, writing why I did or didn't meet my goals, and for the day or week, asking the following questions: 'What went well?', 'What needs work?', and 'How can I improve or optimize?'. I don't like to journal without prompts or structure.
