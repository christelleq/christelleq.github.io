        <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
        <p></p>

        
        
        <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
        <p></p>
      


        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p></p>



        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p></p>



        <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
        <p></p>



        <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
