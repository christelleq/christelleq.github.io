          <h4>Core Values</h4>
          <section>
            <h5>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h5>
            <p>In December 2021, Effective Altruism NZ ran a fundraiser for the Against Malaria Foundation, one of the charities evaluated as most effective. Essentially, you would double or have your donation matched if you contributed to this fundraiser. The limit to how much would be matched was over $56,000. When you see that every extra dollar you spend on yourself could benefit others' lives many many many more times that your own, even save others' lives, every financial decision could be an ethical decision. Should you get that new pair of jeans or donate to a charity that protects families from malaria for a dollar or two a year? I ended up donating $325 to this fundraiser. I weighed this up between my values of effectiveness and contribution on one hand, and personal financial security and ease on the other. It ended up being an easier decision given it was Christmas time and I used my donations as parts of gifts. I presented the donations through cards, writing the cost (around $1.78 per person for 2-3 years) to protect families from malaria through the Against Malaria Foundation. In these cards I also expressed my gratitude and well-wishes for them. So by using this opportunity to express gratitude, to celebrate and to inform others about something very important to me, it was an easy ethical decision to make. The consequence of this decision was 91 bed nets donated to protecting around 182 people from malaria for the next 2-3 years. That's $0.89 per person per year. </p>

            <h5>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h5>
            <p>I was born in Philippines and came to New Zealand 4 days before I turned 9. I was raised in a Catholic, Filipino family. Both my parents grew up in poor families, so it has always been the norm for them to help their families, especially once they came to New Zealand and had more financial capacity to do so. It's normal for Filipinos to work overseas and send money back to family in the Philippines. My parents' example has definitely influenced my value for altruism. Growing up, I wasn't very big on hard work, but now I also take inspiration from my parents' hardwork and organisation. Being raised in my family has probably also contributed to my values for family, education, stability, and loyalty. 
            
            Growing up in New Zealand for the last 14 years, I think the part that has influenced me the most is the easy access to the internet and information in general, especially from libraries. Living in the modern age, in a first world country, I was able to explore what was most interesting and now meaningful to me. I was able to learn from others how best to live. I've been influenced by Stephen R. Covey, and his son Stephen M. R. Covey, Greg McKeown, Cal Newport, Marshall Rosenberg, Thich Nhat Hanh, the Effective Altruism movement... in sum, ideas about effectiveness in life and work, nonviolence, and mindfulness. I highly value wisdom, growth, effectiveness, contribution, and compassion. I think these ideas, values, and my intent to take care of myself, my family and the world speak more to my identity than do the cultures in Philippines and New Zealand.
