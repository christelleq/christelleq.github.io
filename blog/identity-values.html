            <h5>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h5>
            <p>In December 2021, Effective Altruism NZ ran a fundraiser for the Against Malaria Foundation, one of the charities evaluated as most effective. Essentially, you would double or have your donation matched if you contributed to this fundraiser. The limit to how much would be matched was over $56,000. When you see that every extra dollar you spend on yourself could benefit others' lives many many many more times that your own, even save others' lives, every financial decision could be an ethical decision. Should you get that new pair of jeans or donate to a charity that protects families from malaria for a dollar or two a year? I ended up donating $325 to this fundraiser. I weighed this up between my values of effectiveness and contribution on one hand, and personal financial security and ease on the other. It ended up being an easier decision given it was Christmas time and I used my donations as parts of gifts. I presented the donations through cards, writing the cost (around $1.78 per person for 2-3 years) to protect families from malaria through the Against Malaria Foundation. In these cards I also expressed my gratitude and well-wishes for them. So by using this opportunity to express gratitude, to celebrate and to inform others about something very important to me, it was an easy ethical decision to make. The consequence of this decision was 91 bed nets donated to protecting around 182 people from malaria for the next 2-3 years. </p>
