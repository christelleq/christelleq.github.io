        <h3>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h3>

            Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change and adapt. Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people by giving them a framework for how they can change their brains to improve their lives. It gives them hope. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is a list of the ten principles of neuroplasticity.

            Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
          </h4>
          <p>
            I could engage with the principles of neuroplasticity by first of all, reminding myself of this concept. Especially when I want to eat a bar of chocolate, or go on YouTube, or think of something negative and unhelpful. In these moments, I can remember that the less I do these things, the less these behaviours will be grooved in my brain, and the easier it will be to resist these undesirable habits in the future. On the flip side, when I’m establishing a healthy habit, like meditation, I can remember that the more I do this, the easier it will be to do in the future! Also, that the more I meditate, the more mindful, calm, and happy I’ll be!
