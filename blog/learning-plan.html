            <h4>What I expect from the facilitation team</h4>
            <p>I expect to feel safe with the facilitation team. To ask for help and support and know that I will be met with kindness, compassion and understanding. I also expect facilitators to be engaged and keep us accountable, and to be able to help when needed.</p>

            <h4>My commitments for managing the workload in this programme</h4>
            <p>If I start to get <strong>overwhelmed</strong>, I will:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>practice self-empathy</li>
              <li>try to formulate a plan focusing on the essentials</li>
              <li>go for a walk, or a nature hike</li>
              <li>go for a shower, sauna, float, or massage</li>
              <li>talk to a trusted person, e.g. my boyfriend, a facilitator</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I will aim to <strong>relate with others</strong> empathically, respectfully and in ways that grow trust. I will seek to meet commitments, deadlines, standards, and others' needs by making these explicit through writing (even if just in private) and planning: breaking down the tasks, scheduling these tasks (as well as everything in life), anticipating obstacles and listing ways to overcome these obstacles. I know how I show up is highly determined by my wellbeing...</p>
            <p>I am committed to establish <strong>healthy habits</strong> to increase my capacity to do my best in this programme:</p>
            <ul>
              <div>For sleep:
                <li>Be in bed between 8pm-9pm every night.</li>
                <li>To turn off devices and block blue light by 7pm.</li>
                <li>To have a hot shower by 6:30pm.</li>
                <li>To finish dinner by 6:00pm.</li>
              </div><br>
              <div>
                <li>Exercise at least 30 minutes a day or get 10,000 steps.</li>
                <li>Don't consume sugar, flour or vegetable oils.</li>
                <li>Practice nose-belly breathing to a 6-1-8 in-pause-out count for 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meditate for at least 11 minutes a day.</li>
                <li>Practice gratitude.</li>
                <li>Do Carpe Diem journaling from <a href="https://christelle--heroicenterprises.thrivecart.com/optimize-mastery/619ba5355f95b/">optimize.me</a></li>
              </div>
            <p>I will start with committing to practicing the sleep section starting 26 April 2022.</p>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>My Scheduling Information</h4>
            <p>I have work 2 times a week for the next two weeks, and 4 times (not my choice) during Sprint 5. Otherwise, I donâ€™t have any time commitments, although I would like to commit to going to the gym before class with my boyfriend. Until the EDA course, I had responsibilities with taking care of my 6-year-old niece, pick ups and drop offs... but my mother will be taking care of my niece, knowing I am doing a demanding course.
